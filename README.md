# Concussion Project Overview

This repository contains analysis scripts and generated figures examining the relationship between concussion history and various psychiatric outcomes. The project processes Kaplanâ€‘Meier results for different concussion exposures and produces survival curves and forest plots.

## Figures (v4)

Below are the latest v4 figures produced from the current data:

- **Forest Plot**: `forest_plot_v4.svg`
- **Survival Curves**:
  - `survival_mood_disorder_v4.svg`
  - `survival_anxiety_disorder_v4.svg`
  - `survival_adhd_v4.svg`

These figures visualize the risk of mood disorder, anxiety disorder, and ADHD over time following concussion exposures, as well as the comparative risk ratios across concussion counts.

The scripts `EbySurvCurves.R` and `Forest Plot.R` demonstrate how the plots are generated from the CSV files in the `Results` directory. Run them in an R environment with the necessary packages installed to reproduce the figures.
